> When I was taking a vacation, I often lose track of what I have already spent as well as how close I am toward the 
> budget. In this case, I will give up on the budget which I set before the trip since going back to trace each of my 
> expenses during the trip is way too inconvenient. However, I believe a well-budget trip is an important pathway to 
> save money for your next trip. *Personal Travel Accountant* is an application that will help travelers keep their 
> eyes on their money by simply type in the amount and the category of their expenses. Considering the rising desire of 
> travelling with family and friends during the post-pandemic era, *Personal Travel Accountant* also helps travelers 
> keep track of the common funds and transactions between their traveling partners.
