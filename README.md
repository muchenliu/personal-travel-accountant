# *Personal Travel Accountant*

#### *" Make the trip more easy, keep eyes on the money! "*
## Descriptions Of the Application
> The application keeps accounts on the traveling budget includes:
> - recording expenses
> - recording how much is left of your traveling budget
> - split expenses between traveling partners
> - show the cash balance
> - recording by what amount that you owe money to the specific traveling partner
> - recording by what amount that another traveling partner owes you

> When I was taking a vacation, I often lose track of what I have already spent as well as how close I am toward the 
> budget. In this case, I will give up on the budget which I set before the trip since going back to trace each of my 
> expenses during the trip is way too inconvenient. However, I believe a well-budget trip is an important pathway to 
> save money for your next trip. *Personal Travel Accountant* is an application that will help travelers keep their 
> eyes on their money by simply type in the amount and the category of their expenses. Considering the rising desire of 
> travelling with family and friends during the post-pandemic era, *Personal Travel Accountant* also helps 
> keep track of the necessary follow-up transactions between users and their traveling partners.
